2.1
1)There are nine possible values that can be written in a given square, so the branching factor for the successor function is 9.

2) DFS will be finite on the Sudoku problem - eventually the search problem runs out of numbers to use. The maximum search depth is also r, for the same reason. We only have r spaces to work with, so we can only make r choices.

3) The best-case run time complexity for DFS is r (guesses it correctly on the first try). The worst-case complexity is 9^r (branching factor of 9), because the DFS will have to try all possibilities.

4) The best-case for BFS would be 9^(r-1) + 1 , and the worst-case would be 9^r.
  //solution is either the first item in the row (best case) or last item     
  (worst case)

5) The space complexity for BFS is 9^r, in this case. This would yield a space
complexity of 9^40, or 2^126 in base 2. 2^126 is FAR beyond even the age of the universe, so storing 2^126 bytes is clearly impossible.
