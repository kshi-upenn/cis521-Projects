//README for HW02 - Search

Create an instance of SudokuBoard:
	board = SudokuBoard("FILENAME")
Call each search method using object methods:
	//DFS & BFS take a boolean argument for turning pruning on/off
	//board.dfs(True) will make the search much more efficient

	board.dfs()
	board.bfs()
	//BFS & DFS return a tuple of (board,spaceComplexity,timeComplexity)

	board.simAnneal(INTEGER) //Integer is number of iterations
	//return tuple of (board,acceptedDownhill,uphillRejects,uphillAccepted)

//test.py executable included for convenience of testing
//just run from terminal as ./tesy.py with search.py

Test results can be found in results.xls (Excel spreadsheet)
